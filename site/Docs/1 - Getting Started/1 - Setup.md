# Setup a Simple Project

## Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Go get a decent text editor to work with. If you don't already have one, then I highly reccomend giving [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) a shot.

> **NOTE**
>
> The project has been officially tested on *NodeJS **v8.10+***

## Installation

```
npm install ethernet-ip --save
```

 You should be ready to rock!!! ðŸŽ‰
